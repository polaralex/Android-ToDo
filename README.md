# Process Onboarding App with Lists for Android
A complete Android App, built to help university students manage their Erasmus Application Process. It guides the user through a series of steps, along with information for each of them and the ability to easily set calendar notifications.

# So, what's this about?
Back in middle 2016, I developed an Android app as a tool that would help applying Erasmus students in University of Ioannina, to go through the application process. The app was simply called: "Erasmus UOI App". What is Erasmus? See here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Programme. "UOI" is the acronym for my University.

# Why is the code interesting?
Maybe if you are a beginner Android developer, trying to find how some basic (and more intermediate) things work.

Things this app implements:
- RecyclerViews for Lists
- An "app features" slider in the beginning, built using Fragments
- User personalization through a series of interconnected Fragments
- Data persistence using XML parsing/writing
- A hacky way of uploading data to a custom Google Form through HTTP requests
- One-click calendar notifications
- Full Material Design

# What can I do with the code?
I would prefer that you use it to see how I solved some common Android problems. Maybe, along with the posts, will help you understand some specifics of Android development - especially if you are a beginner.

Now, if you want to use parts of it for your own app, I'd like it if you could link back to this repository.

# Do you use any Open-Source code?
The app compiles OkHttp through Gradle.
